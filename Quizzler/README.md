# Quizzler

## Goal of the Assignment

The aim of this project was to further my development skills by introducing me to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, one of the most crucial patterns in mobile app development. Through this tutorial, I deepened my understanding of how to organize code efficiently and learned how design patterns can provide optimized, repeatable solutions to common software problems.

## What I Built

I created a trivia quiz app that allows users to answer both **true/false** and **multiple-choice** questions. As an added challenge, I went beyond the base assignment by introducing additional functionality to store quizzes in a more scalable way, making it easier to add new languages in the future.

## What I Learned

- **Programmatically Changing UI Elements**: I learned how to dynamically update **Labels** and **Buttons** in Swift, which is essential for interactive apps.
- **MVC Design Pattern**: I now understand the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern and how it helps organize and separate the logic of an app.
- **Swift Structs**: I gained a solid understanding of **Structures** in Swift and how to instantiate struct instances.
- **Value Types vs Reference Types**: This assignment helped clarify the differences between **value types** (like Structs) and others, and when to use it.
- **Code Refactoring**: I practiced breaking down and organizing code to ensure it stays clean, efficient, and easy to manage.

## Extra Challenge

For this assignment, I pushed myself further by:

1. **Creating a Separate Swift File in the Model**: I stored the quiz data in a separate Swift file, making it easier to manage and expand. I designed the structure to support multiple languages in the future by storing English quizzes now and adding more languages later.

2. **Handling Answers as Booleans**: Instead of storing both questions and answers as Strings (as recommended), I stored the answers as **Booleans** (true/false). This added an extra layer of complexity but allowed me to handle answer validation more efficiently.
